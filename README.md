Iâ€™m a software engineer and open source maintainer, specializing in Python.

I maintain a blog on software development at https://isaak.dev/, where I frequently share my insights and experiences on various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, as well as offer tips and tricks to help fellow developers improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
